# Milestones

In order to keep a track of each group's progress, it is best to follow the main milestones below. After each milestone, all the groups should take a short break and discuss about the difficulties they encountered while trying to implement the functionalities.

## (0) Env set-up

Make sure the repo is configured and ready for implementation.

## (1) Constructors

Implement the classes:  ```Rover``` and ```Planet```.

## (2) Getters

Implement the getters: ```getDirection```, ```getCoordinates```, ```getSize```, ```getObstacles```.

## (3.1) Move

Implement the main function ```move```.

Each group should implement the functionality in their own way of thinking. There's no proper or correct way of doing it.

## (3.2) Reitaration of Rover.move

All the teams shall discuss and figure out the best way of implementing the method ```move```.

## (4) Mind the constraints

Each group should implement new methods in order to constantly check that the rover does not go out of boundaries.

## (5) Don't crash

Each group should implement new methods to make sure that the rover stops when it encounters any obstacle.

## (6) Pass all the tests

Reitarating until all tests pass and each group obtains a clean solution.

## (7) Q&A

Short Q&A sessions, followed up by short feedback from the participants.
